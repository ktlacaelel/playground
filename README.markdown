A place to experiment with github features


I created this repo to invite anyone who is curious about github
features. to hack, test and play!

so if you have never had the chance to make a pull request join in!
there is no need to be nervous and worry about screwing up when
pushing to a serious repo.

message me, fork, send a pull request and I'll reply and pull.

let the games begin. And lets play!
